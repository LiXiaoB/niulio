- Ensure the requirements.txt is present
- Ensure python3.6 as a default for python3 "alias python3=python3.6"
- Install all python requirements "pip3 install -r requirements.txt"
- If fail to install packages with "pip3 install -r requirements.txt". Simply run the program and install the packages based on the reception message. It won't take much time.
- (Optional) Do "chmod +x run.py" to simplify the running method
- Now run the service! "python3 run.py" or "./run.py" (if you had done the step 4)


Note: Recently we are encountering issues with pip3 on 2 out of 4 of our CSE accounts (2 people canâ€™t run the project after the presentation), where pip3 returns error messages and un-enabling us to install the required packages. This error occurred after our presentation.
